This is the first post on my new blog.

Let me introduce myself!


I'm a programmer from Malappuram, India. I started my career as a Web Developer using Scala and turned into a Mobile Application Developer. At my first job, I got chances to work with many programming languages/frameworks such as Scala, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, Backbone.js. Of them, I am really enjoying working with Javascript. Also, I am an avid Open source enthusiast. 

Currently I am exploring different JavaScript frameworks/libs. Out of everyone of them, I really appreciate how the ReactJS & Vue.JS work when compared to others. I have been learning many new things everyday including languages, tools and bugs since I am working on React and R&D stuffs these days. I think I should share those with others whether it is small or big.

>'First do it, then do it right, then do it better.'

  Yes! i believe in this quote, we need to have the courage to take the first step and IMHO, it works really well.

Currently I am running a company called [Bititude](http://bititude.com) along with [Mahasooq](http://twitter.com/mahasooq). Bititude is a service provider on Web and Mobile application development to clients around places like USA, Australia and Europe. At Bititude, our developments are primarily based on either JavaScript or Native mobile technologies. We give training to our team members to make them Full-Stack Web developers and to let them understand how to code, build, test and deploy a project.

Now we have become somewhat big and are moving soon our office to [ULCyberpark](http://ulcyberpark.com), Calicut.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me at aseem@bititude.com
